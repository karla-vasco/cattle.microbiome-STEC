# cattle.microbiome-STEC
This repository includes 16S rRNA data of cattle feces from five cattle farms. The samples were compared to study differences in the microbiome associated with STEC shedding and prevalence among beef and dairy farms.
The directories include: 
1. Metadata
2. Microbiome files (taxonomy, OTU sequences, relative abundance table, SEPP tree)
3. Picrust2 files (enzymes and KO pathways abundance)
4. R scripts used to calculate statistics and generate figures.
